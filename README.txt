- Responsive Navigation Bar & Pages: Adjusted according to the window size of the screen
- Return All Books/Pay total fine: Allows the users to return all books/pay total fine in by pressing one button rather than returning the book/paying the fine by pressing the buttons one by one (this comes with the assumption that the user wants to return all books/pay all the fines at one go)
